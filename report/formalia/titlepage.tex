\setlength{\parindent}{3ex} As technology progresses, more and more electronics around us become wireless. It’s very important to have high reliability and coverage to maintain these wireless communication links. The upcoming 5G technology promises a feature of ultra-reliable communication with outage probability less than $10^{-6}$. Today it is assumed that the existing statistical models can be extrapolated however the problem is that outages to that low probability has never been tested.\par
The purpose of this paper is to design a system that can measure the outages at these low probabilities and a statistical method to interpret the data to verify if the extrapolation of existing models are still valid.\par
It was found that 4.04$E+6$ independent samples was needed to test to the $10^{-5}$ probability level, and that this should be divided among both temporal and spatial domain. In the end 2.09$E+6$ independent samples was collected, verifying that down to the $10^{-5}$ probability level the measurement strayed only ($1.26\pm 1.23$) dB from the Rayleigh fading model that is being extrapolated today. 

%The first step to this investigation was to determine a sufficient number of samples so the rare phenomena can be observed. After that it was needed to analyze the different ways to obtain these samples due to limited time and environment to measure. Alongside the research for the different domains, it was important to find a dynamic range that would let us detect the deep fades of the signal.
