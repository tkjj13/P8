\section{Brute Force Estimation}
\label{sec:Brute}

An estimate for the number of samples needed to achieve different confidence level and intervals is investigated. The number of samples needed is found using the normal approximation of the Binomial proportion \citep{SampleNumURC}. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:numSamples}
\frac{z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{\gamma}\left(1-\hat{\gamma}\right)}{N_{tot}}}}{\hat{\gamma}} < \text{marg}
\end{equation} 
\begin{where}
\va{$z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$}{is the $100(1-\frac{\alpha}{2})$-th percentile of the standard normal distribution}{1}
\va{$\hat{\gamma}$}{is the estimated probability}{1}
\va{$N_{tot}$}{is the total number of samples needed}{1}
\va{marg}{is the margin around $\hat{\gamma}$}{1}
\end{where}

From the \autoref{chap:introduction} the value of $\hat{\gamma}$ is set to 1E-5. With that estimations of the number of samples needed to uphold different confidence levels and intervals can be found as seen in \autoref{tab:numSample}.

\subsection{Statistics method for rare events}\label{sampleEQ}
As seen in \autoref{tab:numSample}, a low confidence interval requires a substantial amount of independent samples. The reason being the need for a high number of rare events to occur to get a high confidence level of these events. 

For simulation purposes some method have been developed that handles this problem. One of them is importance sampling, which changes the probability of rare events occurring by changing the distribution, so the rare events is not rare anymore. An example of a change in distribution can be seen on \autoref{IMD}, where the weighting factor is describing the change of the distribution see \autoref{IMW}.

\end{minipage}
\vspace{1em}

Importance sampling can not be used as the measurements are taken physically with no a priori knowledge of the fading characteristic in the environment. Another way to look at this is to see the change in distribution as forcefully introducing more spots with deep fades, that might be possible but without full knowledge of the changes it will only skew the results.

Most of the other rare event simulations tools i.e. Stochastic process rare event sampling and Transition path sampling, handles this problem with rare events by using information about the distribution or other a priori information of the environment. As all these method assumes prior knowledge of the distribution neither is suitable for this project.


As no useful statistical method has been found the required number of samples can not be reduced from \autoref{tab:numSample}. Therefore a compromise between the necessary number of samples, and the confidence level/interval needs to be found. A 90\% confidence level and a $\pm$1 dB interval is chosen, as this is found to be a reasonable compromise. This means that the measurement campaign should aim to obtain >$4.04E+6$ independent samples.

\section{Bootstrap Percentile Method}\label{sec_bootstrap}
The estimated values found is based on theory and has no particular onset in the actual measurements, it is therefore necessary to find a method to evaluate the confidence level/interval based on actual measurements. The method chosen is the \textit{Bootstrap Percentile Method} \citep{Bootstrap}.

The Bootstrap method works on a surrogate population, a subset from the total sample space, which is considered an estimate of the true sample population \citep{Bootstrap}. This surrogate population will consists of the samples from the measurements campaign. For the sake of further explanations lets call the surrogate population $\overrightarrow{X}$ consisting of $(x_1, x_2,..x_n)$ and the probability of interest $\hat{\gamma}$. A new subset is now found based on $\overrightarrow{X}$, this is done by copying a random value from $\overrightarrow{X}$ and putting it into a new subset $\overrightarrow{B}$ until it has the same size as $\overrightarrow{X}$. $\overrightarrow{B}$ is then sorted to obtain the \gls{CDF} and the argument, $b_{\hat{\gamma}}$, giving $\hat{\gamma}$ is found. The process is repeated a couple thousand times to stabilize the result. All the new values of $b_{\hat{\gamma}}$ can then be sorted and the the desired percentile can be picked so that the lowest and highest values are left out. This will produce a confidence interval given the confidence level \citep{Bootstrap}. For the measurements the 90 \% confidence level is picked leaving out the top and bottom 5 \% of the sorted values.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Showcase of the bootstrap method, where the surrogate population $\vec{X}$ is made of samples from the real sample population S. From $\vec{X}$ there are randomly copied new subsets $\vec{B}$, with the same size as $\vec{X}$.}
\label{BSEX}
\end{figure}

This method is only valid if the assumption of a symmetric distribution around $\hat{\gamma}$ holds true \citep{Bootstrap}, which means that a high number of samples is still needed to obtain a sufficient resolution of the CDF. 

An example is simulated in matlab, where 4.04E+6 samples is produced using $raylrnd$. These values are sorted, to obtain the CDF, which is the yellow line in \autoref{BS90}. The confidence interval is found by using the bootstrap method 10.000 times and making a CDF for each trial. Then taking the 500th highest and lowest value in each point in the CDF corresponding to the 90\% confidence level, an interval is created, which is shown in \autoref{BS90}. It is seen that at low percentages that the interval becomes wider, as there is a less samples in this region. At the 1E-5 point, there is an interval of $\pm$ 0.82 dB, which is lower than the expected confidence interval for this number of samples. From this example it seems less samples are needed to achieve the desired confidence interval, however this is only the case for this specific simulation as the interval can vary slightly from simulation to simulation.

%Using the normal approximation of the binomial proportion we  estimate the number of samples with 90\% confidence level and an interval threshold of $\pm 25\%$ or 1 dB.Based on the Equation 1.12 we have for $ \bar{x} = 10^{-5} $ :
%\begin{equation}\label{sampleEQ}
%N=(1.645)^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{(0.25)^{2}} \cdot \frac{1-\bar{x}}{\bar{x}} = 4.3 \cdot 10^{6}
%\end{equation}
%Because the above procedure is an approximation we would generate $ 10 \cdot 10^{6} $ number of samples.\citep{SampleNumURC}
