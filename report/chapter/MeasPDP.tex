\chapter{Measurement of PDP}
To find the delay spread and ultimately the coherence bandwidth a \gls{PDP} measurement is necessary. 
\section{Setup}
The PNA is preforming a frequency sweep and using an inverse FFT of the frequency to convert to time domain.
The PDP profile is measured at 20 different positions in the measuring area in \autoref{meas_area} and averaged over. 
\section{Results}

\section{Data processing}

\subsection{Delay spread}
It's clearly a exponential PDP and this means that the coherence bandwidth can be estimated from the previous used approximation from \autoref{bc_aprox}. First the RMS delay spread is calculated from the measured PDP. This gives $\sigma_{\tau} = 14ns$. This is a lower value then the estimated spread.

\subsection{Coherence bandwidth}\label{sec:coherence_bandwidth}
%After the PDP measurements the $B_C$ determined. Together with the $B_C$ and $\Delta f$ the $N_{sweep}$ becomes 41. This will give uncorrelated samples in frequency.
$B_C$ RMS delay spread $\sigma_{\tau}$ because becomes $14ns$. By using the approximation method this gives a $B_C$ of:
\begin{equation}
B_C = \frac{1}{14ns} = 71.43 MHz 
\end{equation}
The $\sigma_{\tau}$ is much shorter then expected and $B_C$ becomes larger. This $B_C$ would give a number of sweep points $N_{sweep} = 14$ and would increase our measurement time drastically.

To figure out a balanced value of $B_C$ an extra test was done. By doing a measurement with $B_C = 5MHz$ and making \gls{ACF} of the values:

\todo{insert pic of autocorrelation test}

Here the test show a correlation of <0.2 with a $B_C = 25MHz$ or the fifth stem. This value is closer to the estimation and increasing the $B_C$ the correlation coefficient starts to flatten out. A $B_C = 25MHz$ would give a  $N_{sweep} = 40$ and is much more desirable then with the approximation method.
