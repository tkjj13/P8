\chapter{Measurement of PDP}
\section{Setup}
To find the delay spread and ultimately the coherence bandwidth a \gls{PDP} measurement is necessary. The PNA is prefomring a inverse FFT of the frequnecy to get to the time.

\subsection{Delay spread}

\subsection{Coherence bandwidth}\label{sec:coherence_bandwidth}
After the PDP measurements the $B_C$ determined. Together with the $B_C$ and $\Delta f$ the $N_{sweep}$ becomes 41. This will give uncorrelated samples in frequency.
\todo{add also Nsweep as part of this}
