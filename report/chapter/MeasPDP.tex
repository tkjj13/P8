\chapter{Measurement of Coherence bandwidth}
To find the coherence bandwidth a delay spread is obtained from a measurement of the \gls{PDP}.
 
\section{Setup}
The NA is preforming a frequency sweep and using an transformation to convert from the frequency to the time domain.
The PDP is measured at 20 different positions in the measuring area seen in \autoref{meas_area} and averaged over.

\section{Data processing}
The raw PDP results can be seen on \autoref{fig:SNRMeas}.

\subsection{Delay spread}
The PDP shows a exponential decay, meaning the coherence bandwidth can be estimated from the previous used approximation in \autoref{bc_aprox}. The RMS delay spread is calculated from the measured PDP and gives $\sigma_{\tau} = 14ns$.

\subsection{Coherence bandwidth}\label{sec:coherence_bandwidth}

$B_C$ can be found from $\sigma_{\tau}$, by using the approximation method:
\begin{equation}
B_C \geq \frac{1}{14ns} = 71.43 MHz 
\end{equation}
This $B_C$ would give a number of sweep points to 14 and would decrease the frequency samples drastically compared to the estimations in \autoref{TIME_EST}.

Because the $B_C$ is higher than expected an extra test was performed. This measurement was done with a frequency separation of 5 MHz, using the \gls{ACF} to determine the frequency correlation:

\input{figures/coherence_test.tex}
\caption{\Gls{ACF} for measurement with a frequency separation of 5 MHz.} 
\label{fig:coh_test}
\end{figure}

Here the \gls{ACF} show a correlation of <0.3 with a $B_C$ = 25 MHz or the fifth stem. This value is closer to the estimated $B_C$ and increasing it has little effect on the correlation coefficient because it flattens out. A $B_C$ = 25MHz gives a $N = 40$ and is more desirable than what the approximation method gave.
