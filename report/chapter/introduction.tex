In all communication an important measure is the channel in which the message is transmitted. For wireless communication this is no different, the message is transmitted from a \gls{TX} through the air and to a \gls{RX}. This transmission can be done in different environments, which have different impacts on the received signal. Common for all the environments is they introduce fading, which if not accounted for can have devastating effects for the transmission.
