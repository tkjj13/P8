\section{Uncertainties}
One of the biggest unsertiency in this prosject is when the freuqnecy span is realtivily big 1Ghz do you acually measure the same channel;Stationariness principle
\todo {Errors when measureing the PDP and the autocorr of the area, becase we moved around and there is not unefomly power}

When designing a measurement campaign prerequisites are important. A large part of the project was understanding how channel behaviour and how this can be represented in a stochastic manner. 

Gathering the number of samples needed for to validate the measured data has proven to be difficult. A big point is that the theory assumes uncorrelated data, but in reality completely uncorrelated samples are hard to obtain. For this reason a much larger sample pool then estimated is needed and will take a long time, where measurements needs to be over several days in different places.

Averaging over the spatial  area also has the effect of averaging over eventual fades, but a completely homogeneous path-loss is hard to obtain in small sized measurement.
