\subsection{Frequency, antenna and space correlation}
From \autoref{div_chap} it is found that correlation should not exceed 0.3 to maximise the diversity gain. If the correlation is under this value, it will be seen as independent in this report. The \gls{ACF} is found across the three dimension of the measurements: frequency, antenna and space/walk, this can be seen in \autoref{4}.

The autocorrelation is calculated with \autoref{EQcor}, across the different domains. The autocorrelation across frequencies, seen in \autoref{1}, is less than 0.3 and therefore considered independent. It can be seen that at lag three the correlation becomes negative, but stabilizes around zero. Normally this would mean that the signal is out of phase, however as it is power values that is not the case. Another aspect is that the correlation is so low that no significant information can be deduced from it.

The autocorrelation across the antennas, seen in \autoref{2}, shows that the correlation between the antennas samples is also small enough to be considered independent. The meaning of the negative correlation is in terms of anti-fading, when one fades the other tends to be above the mean power level, however as there are only three antennas this is a quite bad representation of the \gls{ACF}.

The autocorrelation across space, seen in \autoref{3}, shows a high correlation between adjacent samples in the spatial domain. This high correlation of 0.446 is over the acceptable level of correlation for the samples to be considered independent. The reason for the high correlation could be, the samples have been taken to close to each other resulting in correlation between samples as seen in \autoref{SCFchap}, or it could be due to the stationarity issues mentioned in \autoref{sec:meas_stationarity}.


\subsection{Approximate N Equivalent}\label{approxN}


Given the fact that not all samples are uncorrelated, the sample pool is not big enough to fulfil the required number of independent samples, as it was estimated in \autoref{sec:Brute}. The method used to find the equivalent number of uncorrelated samples that can be extracted from the measurements, is to remove samples from the population strategically to lower the correlation between the samples. From \autoref{4} it can be seen that only the correlation between two adjacent samples in space is above 0.3. By removing every other spatial sample, the new correlation between adjacent samples is 0.165, this can be seen in \autoref{32}. Another advantage is that it reduces the problem of stationarity slightly as can be seen from \autoref{fig:var_space}.

\end{figure}

The drawback of removing half the samples, is that the confidence level/interval wanted in \autoref{sec:statistics} can not be obtained. With the lower number of uncorrelated samples, either or both the confidence interval and confidence level needs to be increased or reduced. By cutting the sample pool down to half (2,092,230 samples), the confidence level at $\pm 1dB$ would be reduced to 76\% or for a 90 \% confidence level the interval will be increased to $\pm 1.33dB$. With the usage of the bootstrap method, the confidence level can be set to the wanted level and the confidence interval can then be found.

\section{Results}

The \gls{CDF} of the measured fading gain is found by sorting \textit{data3} with the probability being the index divided with the number of samples, which is shown in \autoref{CDFFinalBS}. Beside the CDF of the measurements, the 90\% confidence level is shown, which is made with the bootstrap method described in \autoref{sec_bootstrap} and have made 10,000 bootstraps. 

\begin{align}
\overrightarrow{x} = sort(data3)\\
p(x_{(i)}) = \frac{i}{N\cdot M\cdot K} 
\end{align} 
\begin{where}
\va{$\overrightarrow{x}$}{is the 1-dimensional sorted array of \textit{data3}}{1}
\va{$p(\overrightarrow{x_{(i)}})$}{is the CDF of measured data}{1}
\end{where}

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{CDF of the measured fading gain. The min and max is the 90\% confidence level made with the bootstrap method, having made 10,000 bootstraps.}
\label{CDFFinalBS}
\end{figure}


From the bootstrap, the confidence interval can be found at the 1E-5 probability, which is (-53.63 to -50.88) dB or $(51.59\pm 1.37)$ dB. The interval is around the estimation based on the correlation between samples which was found in \autoref{approxN} to be $\pm 1.33$ dB.


To validate if the extensions of the Rayleigh fading model can be used to approximate the probability of very deep fades the relative error of the measurements compared to the model is plotted in \autoref{fig:rel_error}, the relative error is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
err(\overrightarrow{x_{(i)}}) = \frac{p(\overrightarrow{x_{(i)}})-\left(1-\exp(-\overrightarrow{x_{(i)}})\right)}{(1-\exp(-\overrightarrow{x_{(i)}}))}
\end{equation}
\begin{where}
\va{$err$}{is the relative error between measured CDF and Rayleigh CDF}{1}
\end{where}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\input{figures/relative_error.tex}
\caption{Relative error of measurements compared to Rayleigh fading model.}
\label{fig:rel_error}
\end{figure}

By comparing \autoref{fig:rel_error} to \autoref{CDFFinalBS} it can be seen that when the confidence of the measurement decreases the relative error increases. However down to the target probability of 1E-5 the error is only 1.26 dB. 


%The measurements do not fulfil the desired confidence interval at the desired confidence level, as the correlation in space is to high. An approximation sets the total number of independent samples to be around half the size of the total sample population.
