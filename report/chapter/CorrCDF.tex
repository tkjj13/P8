\subsection{Frequency, antenna and space correlation}
From \autoref{div_chap} it's found that correlation shouldn't exceed 0.3 to maximise the diversity gain. If the correlation is under this value, it will be seen as independent in this report. Across the three dimension that the measurements is measured in, frequencies, different antennas and space, the auto correlation is found, which can be seen in \autoref{4}.

The autocorrelation is calculated with \autoref{EQcor}, across the different domains. The correlation across frequencies, seen in \autoref{1}, is less than 0.3 and are therefore considered independent. It can be seen that at lag three the correlation becomes negative, but goes towards zero, when the lag gets high. Normally this would mean that the signal is out of phase, howecver as it is power values that is not the case, however here it implies thatone of the two compared values is generally always below the mean power level. \todo{Check with patricks answer (Talk about negative values)}

The correlation across the antennas, seen in \autoref{2}, shows that the correlation between the antennas samples is also small enough to be considered independent. The reason for the correlation gets negative, is the same as for the frequencies.

The correlation across space, seen in \autoref{3}, shows a high correlation between adjacent samples in the space domain. This high correlation of 0.446 is over the acceptable level of correlation, for the samples to be considered independent. The reason for the high correlation could be, the samples have been taken to close to each other and therefore not been taken with the spacing of $0.4 \lambda$, which is the needed distance to get independent samples, stated in \autoref{SCFchap}, or it could be due to the problems mentioned in \autoref{sec:meas_stationarity}.


\subsection{Approximate N Equivalent}


As seen in previous sections, the samples are too correlated in space. As not all samples are independent, there is not enough independent samples to fulfil required number of independent samples, which was calculated in \autoref{sec:Brute}. To find the equivalent number of independent samples, that can be produces from the measurements, the method used is to remove samples from the population strategically to lower the correlation between the samples. As seen from the previous sections the big problem is the correlation in space, which is the only place where the correlation exceeds the maximum wanted correlation. From \autoref{3}, it can be seen that the correlation between two adjacent samples is 0.446 in space. By removing all samples measured at every other spatial point, the correlation between adjacent samples will be removed and the correlation for one lag (0.165) will be nearly equal to the correlation for two lag (0.166), before the removal of half the samples, seen in \autoref{32}. The other good thing about doing this is it also reduces the problem of stationarity slightly as can be seen from \autoref{fig:var_space}.

\end{figure}

The drawback from removal of half of the samples, is that the confidence level/interval wanted in \autoref{sec:statistics}, can not be obtained, as the number of independent samples is not high enough. With the lower number of independent samples, the confidence interval needs to increase and or the confidence level should be lowered. By cutting the sample pool down to half (2,092,230 samples), the confidence level at $\pm 1dB$ would be lowered to 76\% or the 90 \% confidence interval will be widened to $\pm 1.33dB$. With the usage of the bootstrap method, the confidence level can be set at the wanted level and the confidence interval can then be found.



\section{Results}

The CDF made from the measurements of the fading is shown in \autoref{CDFFinalBS}. Beside the CDF of the measurements, the 90\% confidence level interval is shown, made with the bootstrap method, which have run 100,000 times.

\caption{CDF of the measurements of the fading channel. The min and max is the 90\% confidence level made with the bootstrap method, run 100,000 times.}
\label{CDFFinalBS}
\end{figure}

From the bootstrap, the confidence interval can be found for the $10^{-5}$ point, which is [-53.59; -51.13]. The interval is bigger than the interval, which was calculated in \autoref{sec:Brute}. But with a lower number of independent samples, shown in previous section, this is expected and it inside the calculated $\pm 1.33dB$ interval calculated with the half amount of independent samples.


The results from the measurements of the fading gives a CDF, that compared to Rayleigh fading, seen in \todo{Make figure}, gives a MSE on \todo{find number}. The measurements do not fulfil the desired confidence interval at the desired confidence level, as the correlation in space is to high. An approximation sets the total number of independent samples to be around half the size of the total sample population.
