\section{Environment} \label{Environment}
The High frequency lab at \gls{AAU} (NOVI 9) was used for the measurements, it has clutter and surfaces to give a good representation of an indoor multipath environment. The TX antenna is placed outside of the room pointing towards the door. This provides a \gls{NLOS} condition. The RX antenna array is moved across the opposite side of the room.

%The idea is to do a pilot test of the room. This is to obtain the pathloss $L$ and the delay spread of the room $\sigma_\tau$. With these values we can find the coherence bandwidth $B_c$ and the fading gain can be calculated. 
%We suspect that since this is a multipath NLOS setup the delay spread and pathloss will be very similar across the room. But as a precaution the rooms pathloss and delay will be measured in a close,mid and far region from the doors where the signal originates. When the measurements are ongoing there will be some loss associated with body loss of the handsome scientist and clutter in the environment. This will give more multipath reflections compared to a a empty room.

%With the pilot test done the full measurement can begin. This will use the same setup as for the pilot test, but with three reviver antennas measuring in parallel and different settings on the VNA. Given the results of the pilot test the amount of samples the sweep will obtain in frequency $N_f$ can be terminated. With this the amount of samples in space can be found to get a total of $4.04 \cdot 10^6$ samples. when the measurement starts the antenna array will be moved slowly in space. During the measurement the operate of the PNA will indicate how fast the person holding the antenna array should walk.

\chapter{Setup Parameter estimation}\label{sec:setup_parameter}
Before staring measuring the settings on the NA needs to be estimated. This means that the values has to be balanced to get the needed data and to meet the physical limitations. The theory and the limiting factors have been discussed in \textit{Part I}.


\section{TX power}
The transmit power, $P_{TX}$, is the maximum power the NA can transmit without getting overloaded. This should be as high as possible which for the NA  around 19 dBm \citep{Key_PNA}.

\section{IF-bandwidth(noise floor)}
To estimate the maximum usable $IF_{BW}$, that still meets to the needed SNR, is done by finding the expected received power and estimating the maximum allowed noise floor.  

\subsection{Expected Received Power}
The planned walking route in the room is around 6 meters from the antenna. Using \autoref{eq:ITU_model} this gives a \gls{PL} value of:

\begin{equation}
L = 20log (5000) + 28 \cdot log(6)-28 = 67.76dB \approx 68dB
\label{eq:path_loss}
\end{equation}

The $P_{RX}$ then becomes:
\begin{align}
P_{RX} &= P_{TX} + G_{TX} - L \\
P_{RX} &= 19dBm + 12dBi - 68dB = -37dBm
\label{NFvna}
\end{align}
\begin{where}
\va{$P_{RX}$}{is the received power}{dBm}
\end{where}


\subsection{Theoretic IF-bandwidth}

The $SNR_m$ is known from \autoref{needed_SNR} to be 64 dB. Giving a maximum noise floor as:

\begin{align}
W_{max} &= P_{RX}-SNR_m\\
W_{max} &= -37 dBm -64 dBm = -101 dBm
\end{align}
\begin{where}
\va{$W_{max}$}{is the maximum noise floor allowed}{dBm}
\end{where}

Between (1 to 10) GHz and without averaging, the NA has a typical noise floor of $-119$ dBm with a 10Hz $IF_{BW}$ \citep{Key_PNA}. Now by finding the difference between the $W_{max}$ and the noise floor of the NA we get the amount of $dB$'s that noise floor can be increased without affecting the ability to measure the desired fades:
\begin{align}
diff &= W_{max}-W_{IF}\\
diff &= -101dBm+119dBm = 18dBm 
\end{align}
\begin{where}
\va{diff}{is the difference in noise floor levels}{dBm}
\va{$W_{IF}$}{is the typical noise floor of the NA with $IF_{BW} = 10$ Hz}{dBm}
\end{where}

The noise floor of the \gls{NA} scales linearly with an increased $IF_{BW}$ \citep{PNA_scale}. This means that $IF_{BW}$ on the \gls{NA} can be increased to:

\begin{equation}
IF_{BW} = 10Hz \rightarrow 18dB \rightarrow 630 Hz
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%&= IF_{BW} = -119dB+105dB = 14dB \\
%          \quad &= 10Hz \rightarrow 14dB \rightarrow 250Hz
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
A higher $IF_{BW}$ of 630 Hz  gives a faster sweep time and still meets the requirements set by the $SNR_m$.

\section{Center frequency and Span}
The $f_{c}$ chosen in the setup is 5 GHz because of available antenna array seen in \autoref{OmniDirAnt}. The span is chosen based on two conditions: first it should not influence the spacing of the antenna array too much, secondly the TX antenna needs to have a reasonable equal gain. From \appref{ant_adix} it can be seen that a span of 1 GHz fits roughly with $\pm 1$ dBi gain from the TX antenna.


\section{Number of sweep points}
The delay spread of a signal is very dependant on the environment. For this reason a PDP measurement will measure the delay in the room. Similar indoor values has been measured and shows anything between (20 to 200) ns delay for small office environment \citep{indoor_delay}. Since the environment measured fulfills NLOS conditions a $\sigma_{\tau}$ of 50 ns is assumed. With the RMS delay spread the $B_C$ can be approximated: 
\begin{equation}
B_C \geq \frac{1}{50ns} \approx 20MHz
\label{CohBW1}
\end{equation}

The number of points used in the final setup is dependant $B_C$ and the $F_{span}$. If we use the span of 1GHz and a $B_C$ of 20MHz this gives 50 samples in frequency.

\section{Time estimation}
\label{TIME_EST}
Since the \gls{NA} can do segmented sweeps the sweep time is mostly dependant on the number of points and $IF_{BW}$.
For a 201 point sweep with different $IF_{BW}$ the sweep time can be seen in \autoref{my-label}. There will also be some overhead for saving the data, however this is not known.\\

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
$IF_{BW}${[}Hz{]} & Sweep time {[}ms{]} \\
\hline
10              & 17834               \\
100             & 1825                \\
300             & 641                 \\
1000            & 223                 \\
3000            & 72            \\
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\caption{$IF_{BW}$ vs Sweep time \citep{Key_PNA}.}
\label{my-label}
\end{table}




For an example an $IF_{BW} = 300Hz$ is used to account for the overhead. The example also assumes that a 50 point sweep takes a quarter of the time compared to a 201 point sweep:
\begin{equation}
T_{sweep} = \frac{641 ms}{4} = 160ms
\end{equation}
This means that every 160 ms the RX antennas have to move $0.4 \lambda$ and this gives a relative velocity of:
\begin{equation}
\frac{0.024m}{0.160s} = 0.15 m/s
\end{equation}
The total time for moving 5 meters becomes $\approx 34$ s. With the speculated 31200 samples per 5 meter walk (50 samples in frequency and 3 RX antennas) the total number becomes:
\begin{equation}
\frac{4.04 \cdot 10^6}{31200} = 130 \ walks
\end{equation}
or around 74 minuets of continues measurement given 130 walks and 34 s per walk. These values are subject to change depending on the speed at which the data can be saved and the $IF_{BW}$ needed for the desired noise floor.
