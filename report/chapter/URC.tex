Ultra reliable communication (URC) is a concept, that will be introduced with the new 5G Wireless Systems. (Petar) It is one's of the new features that will come with the 5G network. The 4G network and 4G LTE network works with a block/bit error rate on $10^{-3}$, which is a very normal standard of error rate. But URC introduces a error rate on $10^{-5}$-$10^{-6}$. This of course comes with cost of either higher signal needed to be send, to get a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or lower bit rates, to introduce more error coding. But the return of this, a higher reliability and a lower latency is introduced. By having this two features introduced, more automatic and/or high precision machines can be connected to the network. An example is the use of the cellular network, to get self-driving cars to communicated with each other. In the case, that a car have to make a fast braking action, this have to be communicated to the cars behind it, with high reliability and low latency. So be introducing this URC, the cellular network can be used for more than just communication between humans, but also for fast and precises communication between machines.
