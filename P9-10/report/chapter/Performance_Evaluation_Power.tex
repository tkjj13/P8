\chapter{Battery Lifetime of a NB-IoT Device}
%Here should be an introduction of what we will test (the emulator and/or the protocol). 

The focus of this chapter is to provide an overview and an estimate of the power efficiency of the NB-IoT protocol. From \autoref{ch:NB-IoT} it is known that the desired performance of any IoT protocol is to achieve a battery life time of 10 years with a battery capacity of 5 Wh even in extreme situations. 

In \appref{app:bat_model} the model which will be used to estimate the battery lifetime is described, but to use it effectively several elements needs to be measured on an actual device, these are:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
$E_{sync}$ & the energy used for the modem to boot and synchronise to a cell. \\
$E_{attach}$ & the energy needed to attach the device to the cell. \\
$P_{tx}$ & the power consumption during the data transmission. \\
$E_{release}$ & the energy spent when disconnecting from the cell. \\
$P_{eDRX}$ & the power consumption during \gls{eDRX} idle mode. \\
$P_{PSM}$ & the power consumption during \gls{PSM} idle mode. \\
\end{tabular}

Multiple devices would of cause increase the accuracy of the model, but here only evaluation board for the Quectel BC95 modem is tested \citep{BC95}. Even with that a \gls{NB-IoT} system has a multitude of parameters which influence can the throughput and energy consumption during a transmission and thereby influence several of the states and transitions the device experience. To account for all of this is to huge a task for this project, therefore a couple of parameters is chosen to simplify this task. The downside of this is the reliability of the results as these can only be assume valid in cases where the other parameters are chosen to the same values as used in this project. The values chosen are CP format, operation mode, frequency and $P_{TX}$. The CP format and operation mode is chosen as these are some often mentioned parameters which also only has a few values, repetition could also be considered here however as four different channels can be repeated with each having its own specifying parameter it is chosen to set all repetition to 1 and leave this parameter up to future analysis. The frequency typically has a high influence on the hardware used it is therefore considered as well as the transmit power, $P_{TX}$, which also will have a significant influence on the power consumption when the device is active. Some of the main parameters that are not tested besides repetition is \gls{MCS}, \gls{TBS}, NPRACH start power, NPRACH step size, number of tones, sub-carrier spacing, number of antenna ports and LTE parameters in inband deployment. The influence of some of these parameters is tested by a NDS group at Aalborg University \todo{ref til NDS rapport}. However it will not be further considered here.

From a measurement perspective some of the elements can and should be measured together, these are $E_{sync}$ and $E_{attach}$. This is because these steps are depending on each other and can only be separated during the  post processing. Likewise the $E_{release}$ could be tested simultaneously as it requires the DUT to be connected and depends on most of the same parameters.  



\section{Test Setup}
%Here should be a description of the general setup (including figure) used in all test and a list of baseline values for all parameters. Including physical setup, BSE, UEE.
All the parameters can be tested with the same setup which can be seen in \autoref{fig:IPE_test_setup}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/IPE_test_setup.pdf}
\caption{Setup used to test for the power efficiency of the \gls{DUT}'s}
\label{fig:IPE_test_setup}
\end{figure}
\todo{Make fig in tikz}


As seen in \autoref{fig:IPE_test_setup}, an orchestrator, in this case \gls{TAP}, maintains the system. The orchestrator has a \gls{LAN} connection with the \gls{PSU} and the UXM and in this case a serial connection with the DUT. The \gls{PSU}s connection with the DUT is wires used to power on and analyse the power consumption of the device. It should be noted that the \gls{DUT} in question have two power inputs, one for the device power and one for the RF modem power, here only the modem is connected to the power analyser. The DUT is connected to the UXM using RF SMA cables.

\gls{TAP} is a software developed by Keysight Technologies which enables quick and easy access to the computers external connection. It also allows for C\# features to be used in the test design, meaning test steps can and has been designed to enable functionalities of the instruments. This includes for instance cell activation of the UXM and data collection from the PSU among other key functionalities, this couple with the ability to use loops, parallel test steps, serial com ports and batch scripts make this a very strong tool in designing, controlling and performing measurements. \citep{TAP} 

The \gls{PSU} is a N6705C DC Power Analyzer with the internal module TBD it has a range of TBD. When getting data from the PSU it can be done in a couple different ways, but here it is stored in the internal RAM of the PSU before download. This though has a limitation of 512.000 data points per capture. \citep{PSU}

The base station is a E7515A UXM Wireless Test Set from Keysight Technologies which is able to emulate, both LTE and NB-IoT conditions. It features most of the functionalities in the NB-IoT protocol until release 13. It has a multitude of changeable parameters with easy access through a SCPI interface. \citep{UXM}

The initial settings of each component in the system can be seen in \autoref{tab:setup_parameters}.

The next step is to get the four needed elements. The elements are found as:

\begin{align}
E_{sync} &= \int_{A_{start}}^{A_{end}} f(x) dx \\
P_{attach} &= \mathbf{E}(f(x)) \quad for \, B_{start} \leq x \leq B_{end} \label{eq:mean_over_phase} \\
T_{attach} &=  B_{end} - B_{start} \\
E_{release} &= \int_{C_{start}}^{C_{end}} f(x) dx \\
\end{align}
\begin{where}
\va{$E_{sync}$}{is the energy to boot up and synchronize to the cell}{J}
\va{$P_{attach}$}{is the average power consumption during the attach procedure}{W} 
\va{$T_{attach}$}{is the time it take to attach to the network}{s}
\va{$\mathbf{E}$(•)}{is the mean function}{1}
\va{f(x)}{is the data point at time x}{W}
\va{$A_{start}$}{is the start time of area A}{s}
\va{$A_{end}$}{is the end time of area A}{s}
\va{$B_{start}$}{is the start time of area B}{s}

\va{$C_{start}$}{is the start time of area C}{s}
\va{$C_{end}$}{is the end time of area C}{s}
\end{where}


This is done for all measurements and the results are presented along with their statistical properties in \autoref{fig:Sync_Points}, \autoref{fig:Attach_Power_Points}, \autoref{fig:Attach_Time_Points} \autoref{fig:Release_Points} respectively.

\end{figure}

The parameters can be modelled in several different ways, it is chosen to use a point distribution for both the $E_{sync}$ and $T_{attach}$, a normal distribution for $P_{attach}$ and a lognormal distribution for $E_{release}$ based on the the statistical properties of the parameters. 

It can also be seen from this that the parameters are uninfluenced by CP format, frequency, operation mode and $P_{TX}$ except in the case of $P_{attach}$ where $P_{TX}$ influences the mean value. The parameters can therefore be described as follows:

\begin{align}
E_{sync} &\sim\begin{cases} 1.05\cdot 10^{-6} \quad p = 0.758\\
1.76\cdot 10^{-6} \quad p = 0.242
\end{cases}\\
P_{attach} &\sim\mathcal{N}(0.269,0.173\cdot 10^{-6}) \\
T_{attach} &\sim\begin{cases} 2.215 \quad p = 0.2584\\
2.345 \quad p = 0.4382\\
2.470 \quad p = 0.1124\\
2.615 \quad p = 0.1573\\
2.725 \quad p = 0.0337
\end{cases}\\
E_{release} &\sim \text{Lognormal}(-3.5287,0.1277)
\end{align}

As mentioned the parameter $P_{TX}$ influences the mean value of the power consumption during the attach procedure, it is therefore looked upon separately in \autoref{fig:Attach_Pmax}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\tikzsetnextfilename{Attach_Pmax}
\resizebox{0.7\textwidth}{!}{
\input{figures/QuectelMeas/Attach_Pmax.tex}}
\caption{Average power consumption as a function of $P_{TX}$ during the attach procedure.}
\label{fig:Attach_Pmax}
\end{figure}

From \autoref{fig:Attach_Pmax} it can be seen that the power consumption can be approximated using two functions based on the value of Pmax this can be contributed to the usage of a power amplifier. 



\section{Transmit Power Consumption}

To measure the transmit power consumption the UXM needs to enable the MAC padding this is done in both UL and DL to ensure the maximum utilization of the device. 

\subsection{Test Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Setup the \gls{DUT} as shown on \autoref{fig:IPE_test_setup}
\item Turn on power supply 
\item Put in settings as described in \autoref{tab:setup_parameters} 
\item Enable MAC padding in UL and DL
\item Input chosen value of chosen parameter
\item Input to log "start <Parameter used> <Parameter value>"
\item Put device in connected state
\item Measure power output over 35 s
\item Change to next value
\item Repeat step 5-9 for all values.
\item Save measurements as "Transmit/<Parameter used>/Messagelog.csv"
\item Change to next parameter
\item Repeat step 5-12 for all parameters.
\item Turn off power supply
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{figure}[H]

\resizebox{0.6\textwidth}{!}{
\input{figures/QuectelMeas/Transmit_raw.tex}}
\caption{Example of raw measurements of the transmit case.}
\label{fig:Transmit_raw}
\end{figure}

The next step is to find the average power consumption as:
\begin{equation}
P_{transmit} = E(f(x))
\end{equation}
\begin{where}
\va{$P_{transmit}$}{is the average power consumption during transmit state}{W}
\end{where}

This is done for all parameters and the result can be seen in \autoref{fig:Transmit_Points}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}
\tikzsetnextfilename{Transmit_Points}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{

\input{figures/QuectelMeas/Transmit_Stat.tex}}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Average power consumption when in transmit state.}
\label{fig:Transmit_Points}
\end{figure}

As $P_{transmit}$ shares several traits with $P_{attach}$ it can also be modelled using a Gaussian distribution with $P_{TX}$ setting the mean value this can be from \autoref{fig:Transmit_Points} and \autoref{fig:Transmit_Pmax}. The mean is split into two models for the transmit part as expected from the attach measurements. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\tikzsetnextfilename{Transmit_Pmax}
\resizebox{0.7\textwidth}{!}{
\input{figures/QuectelMeas/Transmit_Pmax.tex}}
\caption{Transmit Pmax}
\label{fig:Transmit_Pmax}
\end{figure}

This means that $P_{transmit}$ can be modelled as:
\begin{align}
&P_{transmit} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{Pmax},11.034\cdot 10^{-6}) \\ \nonumber
&\mu_{Pmax} = \begin{cases} 0.0433\cdot\exp{(0.0002\cdot x)} + 4.13\cdot10^{-3}\cdot\exp{(0.116\cdot x)} \quad for x \leq 8 dBm \\
0.0399\cdot\exp{(0.0442\cdot x)} + 22.3\cdot10^{-6}\cdot\exp{(0.545\cdot x)} \quad for x > 8 dBm \end{cases}
\end{align}


\section{Idle Mode Power Consumption}
Four different kinds of idle mode exist for a NB-IoT device: \gls{cDRX}, \gls{DRX}, \gls{eDRX} and \gls{PSM}. It is chosen not to look into \gls{cDRX} due to an assumption of the device transmitting its data quickly and then going into deep sleep. The setup to test this can be seen in \autoref{fig:IPE_test_setup}.

When the device is in idle mode most parameters lose their influence entirely. Because of this a whole new set of parameters should be considered. For the \gls{DRX} case the cycle period is important, while for \gls{eDRX} however a few parameter more should be considered such as the repetition of the DRX cycle and the eDRX cycle period. For \gls{PSM} its is also the DRX cycle period as well as the repetition of the DRX cycle as well as the PSM cycle time. This can be summed up to two different types of parameters: period lengths and repetition numbers. It is assumed that both of these parameters have a proportional relation to the energy consumption of the idle modes, this means that only a single instance of the power consumption is needed for these different idle modes to extrapolate from.

Because of this a new set of parameters need to be defined for the UXM, as can be seen in \autoref{tab:UXM_idle_values}.

\begin{table}[H]

\label{fig:eDRX1}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in the raw measurements each mode has several phases. Phase A of each measurement can be omitted from the analysis since this is the attach phase, which has already been covered in \autoref{sec:performance_attach}. The average power consumption is found for each of the other areas following \autoref{eq:mean_over_phase}, for each area. The results can be seen in \autoref{tab:idle_results}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} 
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ }	& \multicolumn{4}{c}{Area} \\ \hline
\textbf{Mode}	& \textbf{B}	& \textbf{C} 	& \textbf{D} 	& \textbf{E} \\ \hline
DRX				& 1.898 mW		& - 			& - 			& - \\ \hline
eDRX			& 3.653 $\mu$W	& 1.901 mW		& 5.738 $\mu$W	& 1.903 mW \\ \hline
PSM 			& 1.520 mW		& 3.919 $\mu$W	& 31.62 mW		& - \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}
\caption{Average power consumption of the individual areas for the the three idle measurements.}
\label{tab:idle_results}
\end{table}

It can be seen that the average power consumption of the DRX period is almost equal to the average power consumption of the PTW of the eDRX cycle, this is also expected. It can further be seen that the in the off periods of the eDRX cycle the Quectel device shuts down to the same state as in PSM mode. This could  mean one of two things, either the device has very bad hardware meaning the PSM power consumption is very high, or as in this case the hardware is very good and it can keep the timing sufficiently with only the timer needed to run PSM mode. This means that the power consumption during the eDRX idle periods can be counted as PSM period. This means that only two values is needed to describe the power consumption during the idle phase $P_{DRX}$ and $P_{PSM}$:
\begin{align}
P_{DRX} &= 1.901 [mW] \\
P_{PSM} &= 4.437 [\mu W]
\end{align}


\section{Battery Life Time Estimations}

Now that all the power values are known the battery lifetime can be estimated. To do this however the influence of some cell specific parameters as well as some assumptions of the transmit time is needed. As stated in \appref{app:bat_model} the model used to estimated the battery life time is:

\begin{equation}
L(t_i) = \frac{C_{bat}\cdot SF_{bat}}{8760\cdot (P_m(t_i) + P_{device})}
\end{equation}
\begin{where}
\va{$L(t_i)$}{is the expected lifetime of the battery}{years}
\va{$t_i$}{is the transmission time interval}{s}
\va{$C_{bat}$}{is the capacity of the battery}{Wh}
\va{$SF_{bat}$}{is the safety factor of the battery}{1}
\va{$P_m(t_i)$}{is the power consumption of the modem}{W}
\va{$P_{device}$}{is the power consumption of the IoT device}{W}
\end{where}

This equation is used under the assumption that $P_{device}$ is negligible, that there is no mobile terminated data occurring and setting $SF_{bat}$ to 0.5 and $C_{bat}$ to 5 Wh, giving:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bat_est}
\begin{gathered}
	L(t_i) = \frac{1.0274}{P_m(t_i)} \\
	P_m(t_i) = \frac{E_{active} + E_{idle}}{t_i} \\
	E_{active} = E_{sync} + P_{attach}\cdot T_{attach} + P_{transmit}\cdot T_{transmit} + E_{release} \\
	E_{idle} = \begin{cases} P_{DRX}\cdot T_{DRX} + P_{PSM}\cdot (t_i - T_{attach} - T_{transmit} - T_{DRX}) \quad \text{for PSM}\\
							P_{DRX}\cdot T_{PTW} + P_{PSM} \cdot (T_{PSM} - T_{PTW}) \qquad\qquad\qquad\quad\;\;\, \text{for eDRX}
				\end{cases}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

From \autoref{eq:bat_est} a couple of problems become visible. First is that the time to sync and release of the devise from the system has not been taken into account. This however will only influence the estimation slightly as the time is essentially added to the idle time and only amounts to a few seconds. Second is that $E_{active}$ depends on two parameters one of which has not been measured or in any other way classified, namely $P_{TX}$ and $T_{transmit}$\todo{Refresh sentence, so Mads understands}. Because $T_{transmit}$ depends not only on the amount of data the devise wants to transmit, but also on some cell specific parameters such as repetition etc. will it be considered as a separate parameter for the battery lifetime estimation. As $P_{TX}$ depends on the channel condition for the device it is also as a separate parameter. The third problem is that $E_{idle}$ is depending on several things first is which idle mode is used second is what timer values are associated with the idle mode. Since this potentially has severe consequences for the power consumption the impact of this is also elaborated upon. The forth problem is also with the model used to estimate $E_{idle}$ for PSM mode it is assumed that T3412 is always bigger than $t_i$ meaning that only when the device has data will it wake up from PSM and for eDRX the energy is calculated based on a complete cycle which might be interrupted by the data transmission, this issue become less relevant with larger $t_i$ and smaller $T_{PSM}$. 

A common factor for all these problems is the model will underestimate the battery lifetime except in the case of T3412 being larger than $t_i$, however as the assumptions made here helps simplify the model it is considered to be reasonable. Another important step in this regard is that for all the measured parameters a statistical analysis was made, based on this analysis values are chosen such that there is a 95\% confidence that the device will life for the estimated time or in other words such that at least 95\% of the values are below the chosen value. To start the analysis of the battery lifetime four cases are chosen for idle mode eDRX and PSM respectively, the values for these cases can be seen in \autoref{tab:case_description}. This is done to visualize the impact of the chosen mode and timer values, a case where only DRX is used is not considered as this should only be relevant for very low $t_i$'s and then it is covered by eDRX and PSM already.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
		& $T_{DRX}$	& $T_{PSM}$	& $T_{PTW}$	& $T_{Transmit}$	& $P_{TX}$ 	\\ \hline
Case 1	& 2 s 		& 20.48 s	& 5.12 s	& 1 s				& 20 dBm	\\ \hline
Case 2	& 10 s		& 163.84 s	& 10.24 s	& 1 s				& 20 dBm	\\ \hline
Case 3	& 50 s		& 1310.72 s	& 20.48 s	& 1 s				& 20 dBm	\\ \hline
Case 4	& 250 s		& 10485.76 s& 40.96 s	& 1 s				& 20 dBm	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Timer settings for the four cases.}
\label{tab:case_description}
\end{table}

The expected battery lifetime for these four cases is found for different $t_i$'s as can be seen in \autoref{fig:eDRXvsPSM}.

\caption{Battery life time estimation for the four cases for different $t_i$'s. Full line using PSM, dashed line using eDRX.}
\label{fig:eDRXvsPSM}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in \autoref{fig:eDRXvsPSM} the longer the $t_i$ the more impactful the these parameters become which makes sense as more time is spent in idle mode. What is also interesting to note is that each case is going asymptotic towards certain values and that eDRX is more influenced by the timer values than PSM is. To give a more clear picture of the influence of the timer values the $t_i$ is set to 24 hours and the timer values are changed are varied to a further extent this can be seen in \autoref{fig:TimerPlot_plots}.

\caption{Influence of timer settings for the estimated battery lifetime.}
\label{fig:TimerPlot_plots}
\end{figure}

From \autoref{fig:TimerPlot_plots} it can be seen that the values for the eDRX timers are very influential as the expected lifetime is varying  from 0.075 years to 10.78 years, where for PSM the lifetime only varies from 10.97 to 10.13 years. The next step is to look at the influence of $T_{transmit}$ and $P_{TX}$. To do this four scenarios are picked such that the differences for high and low $t_i$'s in each idle mode can be compared, the values chosen to showcase this can be seen in \autoref{tab:scenario_description}.


\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
			& $t_i$ 		& Idle mode	& $T_{DRX}$	& $T_{PSM}$	& $T_{PTW}$	\\ \hline
Scenario 1	& 1 hour 	& eDRX 		& -			& 5242.88 s	& 10.24 s	\\ \hline
Scenario 2	& 24 hours 	& eDRX 		& -			& 5242.88 s	& 10.24 s	\\ \hline
Scenario 3	& 1 hour 	& PSM		& 10 s		& -			& -			\\ \hline
Scenario 4	& 24 hours 	& PSM		& 10 s		& -			& -			\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Parameter values chosen for each scenario.}
\label{tab:scenario_description}
\end{table}

For each of the four scenarios the transmit power and transmit time is varied independent of each other and the battery lifetime is estimated for each combination as seen in \autoref{fig:lifetime_plots}.

\label{fig:lifetime_plots}
\end{figure}

Here it can be seen again that the values of these parameters have a huge effect. Especially $T_{transmit}$ which alone can bring the lifetime down to less than a year no matter the other parameters. A realistic value for $T_{transmit}$ is not really known as it depends heavily on the usages as well as a multitude of cell parameters. To clarify the utilization of the energy spent four points has been picked out from each plot in \autoref{fig:lifetime_plots}. The values of each point can be seen in \autoref{tab:point_description}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
& $T_{Transmit}$ & $P_{TX}$ \\ \hline
Point 1 & 100 ms& -20 dBm  	\\ \hline
Point 2 & 100 s	& -20 dBm  	\\ \hline
Point 3 & 100 ms& 23 dBm 	\\ \hline
Point 4 & 100 s	& 23 dBm 	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Points chosen to investigate.}
\label{tab:point_description}
\end{table} 

For each of the points in each of plots the energy usages has been divided up into five parts corresponding to the five parts in the model: 	sync, attach, transmit, release and idle. The result of which can be seen in \autoref{fig:barplot_plots}.

\caption{The distribution of power for each phase of a cycle. Blue is the sync phase, red is the attach phase, yellow is the transmit phase, purple is the release phase and green is the idle phase.}
\label{fig:barplot_plots}
\end{figure}

It can be seen that depending on the point and scenario the energy is used quite differently, however some commonalities can be seen. For instance if each transmission is 100 s more than 80\% of the energy is spent during the transmit phase if $P_{TX}$ is also high then more than 99\% of the energy is spent here. Likewise can it be seen that the energy used to synchronise the devise is less negligible. It can also be seen that only when the $t_i$ is high does $E_idle$ take op more than 9\%. Also the energy spent during the attach phase is quite high only really topped by the energy spent during a long transmission and comparable to the energy used during the idle phase for scenario 2 and 4. 

With this analysis it can be concluded that a device will find it hard to achieve a battery lifetime of 10 years in extreme conditions based on the fact that it will increase not only the needed $P_{TX}$ but also the repetition which increases $T_{transmit}$. When these parameters are high it has been shown that a battery lifetime might not even exceed one year independently on all other parameters. To combat this the only way is really to focus in decreasing $T_{transmit}$ as much as possible.
