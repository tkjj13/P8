 \section{Network Structure}

The network structure of \gls{NB-IoT} is very similar to that of legacy \gls{LTE}, as can be seen on \autoref{fig:network_structure}. The system is divided into a control plane \gls{CIoT} \gls{EPS} optimization and a user plane \gls{CIoT} \gls{EPS} optimization.

\subsection{Device}
The device is the smart meters or other products as mentioned before, they do not need to transmit a lot of data and the latency of the payload is not critical. They do however require a long battery lifetime. The problem comes in terms of placement because many of these devices might be placed in a basement like environment, with a high path loss. \citep{REL-13,book_LTE_for_UMTS}

\subsection{\gls{CIoT} \gls{RAN}}
The \gls{CIoT} \gls{RAN} is the network of base stations, where the most typically used is the \gls{eNB} base station. Any device that wish to use an external service, communicates with the \gls{eNB} \citep{book_LTE_for_UMTS}. The \gls{eNB} communicates with both the \gls{MME} and the \gls{SGW}. The \gls{eNB} is in charge of \gls{RRM}, i.e. allocating radio resources in the user plane to the individual device based on \gls{QoS} measures. 

\subsection{\gls{MME}}
The \gls{MME} takes care of mobility issues and keep track of where in the network different devices are connected \citepalias{3GPP_MME_spec}. Another very important function of the \gls{MME} is to handle authentication of devices and setting up security for the data bearers. The \gls{MME} might be connected to multiple devices, however, a device may only be connected to a single \gls{MME} \citep[ch. 3]{book_LTE_for_UMTS}. The \gls{MME} might serve a particular geographic area with several \gls{eNB}s. In \gls{NB-IoT} handovers are omitted and the only way to change cell is by releasing the existing connection and connect to the new cell\citep{REL-13}. The \gls{MME} also handles paging procedures \citep{NB-IoT_Book}.

\subsection{\gls{HSS}}
The \gls{HSS} stores the identity of the devices, which the \gls{MME} uses for authentication purposes. It records the location of the device in level of visited network control nodes, such as \gls{MME}. It also keeps track of which networks the device is allowed to roam to \citep[ch. 3]{book_LTE_for_UMTS}.

\subsection{\gls{SCEF}}
The \gls{SCEF} is in charge of multiple tasks, including device trigger delivery, sponsored data, device reachability, \gls{3GPP} network issues, \gls{QoS} for a device session etc. Many of these functionalities are meant for normal \gls{LTE} use. Uses meant for \gls{NB-IoT} include device reachability, which enables the application layer to be informed when a device reconnects to the network i.e. after a \gls{eDRX} or  \gls{PSM} period. Another functionality it handles is \gls{NIDD}, which enables devices with small data volumes to send its data with less overhead and thereby have a longer battery lifetime \citepalias{3GPP_SCEF_primer}.

\subsection{\gls{SGW}}
The \gls{SGW} is primarily a routing unit. It interfaces with the \gls{eNB}, the \gls{MME} and the \gls{PGW}. When the device transmits data, it is sent to the \gls{eNB} and then routed via the \gls{SGW} to the \gls{PGW}, before reaching the providers. The \gls{SGW} typically serve a particular geographic area with several \gls{eNB}s. In \gls{LTE} this was the last node in the network that could change during a connected state, meaning that all \gls{SGW}s needs to be connected to all \gls{PGW}s \citep[ch. 3]{book_LTE_for_UMTS}. This is however not equally important in \gls{NB-IoT}, as no handovers are possible \citep{REL-13}. During connected state the \gls{SGW} works as a relay, however in idle mode the resources are released in the \gls{eNB} and the data path terminates at the \gls{SGW}. It then stores the data from the \gls{PGW} and requests the \gls{MME} to initiate paging of the device \citep[ch. 3]{book_LTE_for_UMTS}.

\subsection{\gls{PGW}}
The \gls{PGW} is the edge of the \gls{EPS}. It function as the point of attachment for the devices \gls{IP} traffic. The \gls{IP}-address of the device is allocated during the connection procedure, when the device request a \gls{PDN} connection and during any subsequent \gls{PDN} connection request. It is the \gls{PGW} that performs the \gls{DHCP} functionality \citep[ch. 3]{book_LTE_for_UMTS}.

\subsection{\gls{PCRF}}
The \gls{PCRF} is a server that makes a decision on how to handle services provided for the device, based on \gls{QoS} measures. It informs the \gls{PGW} about appropriate bearer policy that can be set up. A default bearer is set up during connection request and either the device or the service domain can request additional bearers, which is handled by the \gls{PCRF} \citep[ch. 3]{book_LTE_for_UMTS}.

\subsection{\gls{CIoT} Services}
The \gls{CIoT} services are typically storage functionalities but could be control algorithms or other services needed for specific products.
