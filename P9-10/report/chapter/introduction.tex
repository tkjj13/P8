%\section{Motivation}
%Why is the topic of interest? 
%New technology
%	IoT development
%	Massive number of devices
%	5G

The market of cellular technologies is changing and the need for a new type of technology has arisen. This is the need for \gls{LPWA} networks, \gls{LPWA} networks are classified by three main aspects: long battery lifetime, low cost units and huge amount of users or devices. With the development of \gls{LPWA} networks, especially with the development of 5G and other \gls{IoT} technologies, an increased focus has come to the massive part of communication. It was estimated that in 2016 0.4 billion devices were of the \gls{LPWA} type, but this is predicted to reach 1.5 billion by 2021, equivalent to a yearly growth rate of 27 \% \citep{mobi-report}. This change sets some requirements that is not achievable with existing systems, however to accommodate this several technologies have been developed.


Generally the new technologies are classified into categories: (i) cellular networks based solution (ii) proprietary solutions the most renowned of which can be seen in \autoref{fig:IoT_protocol_overview}. All these technologies are competing to be the main standard of massive \gls{IoT} communication.

\section{Problem Analysis}
%What is the problem?
%	Many standards

%Problem statement!

Even though, the technologies in question have already been designed most is still in their infancy, because of this most metrics that can be found for the different protocols, are to the authors knowledge based on a theoretic approach and not on actual measurements.

It can be seen from \autoref{tab:tech_comparison1}, that the different technologies have different advantages. The main differences between them are the bandwidth of the receiver as well as the battery lifetime. 

As none of the protocols have been deployed at a large scale, it brings up different concerns especially because the massiveness in question is several times larger than anything seen before. Therefore to choose the main standard a lot of metrics are taken into consideration divided into three domains: reliability, energy consumption and massiveness i.e. the amount of supported users per km$^2$ or cell. The general scenario of an IoT device is a small not latency critical payload which comes at regular intervals, examples could include smart meters, household equipment and surveillance. Therefore the aim is to have long battery lifetime as a lot of the devices might not be connected to a power grid, the reliability is in most cases not critical but depending on the retransmission scheme chosen a low reliability might result in unnecessary stress on the network which might decrease performance for both massiveness and energy consumption of the devices. Another concern is that some of the devices might be placed in hard to get to locations and battery change and device replacement should be kept at a minimum.


%One of the aims of \gls{IoT} devices is a battery lifetime of around 10 years, to achieve this requirement for the energy consumption is of course a key metric. With the scope of billions of devices, several metrics in regards to the massiveness will also be extremely important. Because of the long lifetime coupled with the extreme number of devices the reliability also needs to be very high as it is not feasible to replace devices quickly. 
%\todo{Either add payload as a extra domain or rewrite the part about reliability}

This leads to the problem statement:
\begin{center}
\textbf{As the IoT market is still in its infancy the proposed protocols needs to be evaluated based on metrics of the reliability, energy consumption and massiveness to choose a main IoT protocol.}
\end{center}

%Several different metrics can be tested for each of the domains some are protocol specific others while others are more general. Examples of performance metrics are:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item[\textbf{A}] \textbf{Massiveness}
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Time to connect vs. connection request per second 
%		\item Data rate vs. number of users
%		\item Spectrum use vs. number of users
%		\item Interference level vs. number of users
%	\end{itemize}		
%	\item[\textbf{B}] \textbf{Energy consumption}
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Energy consumption vs. data rate
%		\item Energy consumption vs. coverage level
%		\item Energy consumption vs. operation mode
%		\item Energy consumption vs. number of UEs
%		\item Energy consumption vs. cellular protocol
%		\item Energy consumption cellular vs. proprietary
%	\end{itemize}
%	\item[\textbf{C}] \textbf{Reliability}
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Delay
%		\item \gls{BER} vs. \gls{SINR}/\gls{MCL} vs. protocol

The idea for this project is to design an emulator combining both software and hardware, that can test how the standards perform in the different domains. For this purpose emulation of multiple low performance \gls{IoT} devices is needed. The system should also be able to simulate neighbouring cells to achieve realistic channel conditions. Implementation of a signal processing method that allow to change to different channel models would be optimal. The aim being a customizable emulator which provide performance metrics of the different protocol designs.

%\textbf{Limits of project} \todo{check this when it is decided to to do track 1 or 2}\\
However as this is a huge endeavour, the focus will be on the core principles of this making a proof of concept emulator. When making an emulator it generally only works for a single protocol so designing it for several protocols would be very time consuming and it is chosen that the benefit of supporting several protocols is not worth the extra time it takes to design the emulator. Another factor is the project will build upon existing software as just designing the \gls{BSE} or \gls{IoT} device emulator could easily be an entire project in itself. Based on this different factors are taken in to account when choosing the protocol for the project which can be seen in \autoref{tab:protocol_decision}.

\label{tab:protocol_decision}
\end{table}

%Based on \autoref{tab:protocol_decision} the \gls{NB-IoT} protocol is chosen. This is based on the fact it uses the licensed spectrum as well as the solutions available. Also it is chosen to primarily look at the massiveness aspect of the protocol. \todo{check with germans comments}%check this again before hand-in}

When looking at \autoref{tab:protocol_decision} it can be seen that for \gls{LTE} Cat-0 no \gls{UE} emulator was found. This has to do with the development of \gls{LTE} Cat-M and \gls{NB-IoT} which shares most of the same properties but are more specialised to the \gls{IoT} market. It can also be seen that for both \gls{LTE} Cat-M and \gls{NB-IoT} multiple \gls{UE} emulators exist, this has to do with both protocols being cellular protocols developed by \gls{3GPP} this is very desired by the industry for various reasons. For \gls{LoRa} there exists both  \gls{BS} and \gls{UE} emulators, it is also one of the most used proprietary protocols on the market. For the Sigfox protocol no \gls{BS} emulators has been found. Based on these investigations it is chosen to use the \gls{NB-IoT}, both because it has a lot of emulators already but mainly because the bandwidth is less than LTE CAT-M. The reason a small bandwidth is desired is based on another project, where it was found that decreasing the bandwidth increased the number of UE's the system could handle \citep{thesis_report}. Work from this project will also be utilized when designing the emulator for this project.


To make the most realistic emulation the final solution needs to work in real time, this sets some limitations performance wise. One of the problems associated with real time computation is the computational capacity meaning the emulator might not be able to handle several thousands \gls{UE}s simultaneously as the deployed system is required to. This is further explored in \autoref{ch:mass_test}.

Another limit that has been set for the project is to exclude the reliability domain. This is done partly because it believed to be the domain with the least concern of the three and partly because any one of the domains, are large enough to fill out the scope of the project. The focus in the project is split between the energy consumption and massiveness and in both cases further limits still needs to be set. For the massiveness only a single cell is will be used and the channel will consist of a path loss only as this is all that is needed to validate a proof of concept model. The primary concern here will also be the key functionalities and an API will not be prioritized. For the energy consumption existing emulators will be used for both the UE and BS and the focus is limited to show the influence of a few key parameters. %The emulator is designed in modules, which in the future could be put together to one complete system.  

This outline the scope of the project, but before going into the details of the emulator an introduction to the \gls{NB-IoT} protocol is made in the following chapter.



% \todo{Need more fill, as why we do not focus on these parts and also very hard cut off for a section}





%To make an emulator for all the technologies mentioned would not be feasible in the time frame of the project therefore one is picked to prove the concept. The \gls{NB-IoT} is chosen because it provides a good compromise of data rate and battery life time, as well as being compatible with \gls{LTE}. Another factor for choosing \gls{NB-IoT} is that Keysight has provided the opportunity to test the system with their UXM base station, as well as \gls{SRS} developing an \gls{UE} for the \gls{NB-IoT} system. 

 
%To achieve this existing software will form the base but might need to be redesigned to minimize duplicate operations along with fulfilling the massive aspect. Finally
